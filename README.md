### Async handling
Mixing promises and observables, mainly because I wanted to try out RxJS.
As you'll see, I haven't quite figured out yet how to integrate this approach
in my workflow so sometimes I fall back on promises. Perhaps a mix _is_ the best approach 
or maybe this project wasn't quite suited for this experiment. Anyhow... 

### Functional approach
Also trying out a more functional approach but didn't go anywhere near the whole hog
so you're looking at a mongrel mix of (poor) functional code and normal OOP.
